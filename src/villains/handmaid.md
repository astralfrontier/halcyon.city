They say idle hands are the Devil's workshop. This lady has been anything but idle.

Handmaid is a one-trick pony among villain gadgeteers. Other inventors build everything from force fields to mechanical T-rexes to power armor. Handmaid has one gimmick, but it's a good one. She builds robot hands.

The hands are clearly robotic. Four fingers and a thumb, articulated like a human's hand. They have two video cameras, one in the palm and one on the back of the hand, plus microphones and a few other simple sensors. The wrist can rotate all the way around. Below the wrist there's a cylinder, about four inches long, like a human forearm. That's where the power pack and computer live that drive the things. At the end of the forearm, there's two parallel handles, large enough for somebody to grab hold of. They're able to move themselves around

A senior villain (who I won't name) asked me my opinion before they hired her as a lieutenant. I didn't know much about her, I admitted, so I was paid a good sum to go find out. I anonymously fed Handmaid the details of a job, then went along secretly to see how she did.

The job was at the docks. A piece of valuable cargo was being shipped in anonymously inside a freight container. There would be plainclothes security, and the cops would be called if anything happened, obviously. There's going to be eyes on the prize 100% of the time, so Handmaid (correctly) concludes that she can't just exfiltrate the package, she's going to have to make some noise.

First thing she does is station some of her hands with wire cutters at the junction box for the phone system. More hands drive a stolen van - some operating the wheel, some on the pedals - through the gate. There's a big explosion, since she loaded the thing with propane and rigged the whole van as a low-tech fuel-air bomb. Nobody gets killed, that's not the point, but a few of the security goons peel off to check it out.

Meanwhile, she's got a big pile of hands throwing each other in sequence, lashed together with high-tensile Polyamide wire. A few hands will throw one of their fellows, then that one will latch onto something and reel the others to it. A few of them divert to the security office, trip one of the port security guys, grab his radio, and put a thumb down on the transmitter. Now the local security channels are being squelched. The rest of the hands pick the lock on the security back-room and get into the paperwork. Their built-in cameras relay the container ID where the valuable dingus is stored.

A chunk of the hands are now getting into a fistfight with the remaining security guys, which was far funnier to watch than I can ever describe here. While they're distracted, about a dozen hands get to the container, then start levering open the door. The dingus is inside, so they grab hold of it. All those hands behind them, the ones that have been throwing each other around? They're still around, still wired up, so they begin reeling in the hands with the prize.

The phones have been cut but the cops got the call anyway, so they show up about this time. A contingent of hands have been left behind. Now they start throwing themselves at the cops and grabbing at their guns. When a hand grabs a gun, its fellows reel it back in and the cluster of hands arms itself. The cops get shot at with their own weapons.

Handmaid herself has some of the hands on her person. She throws them like a grappling hook - a hand grabs hold, then reels her in with the attached wire - and makes a very quick getaway while the cops are distracted. She's got a collection of hands around her torso like a bandolier, and they're holding the dingus on her back like a backpack. The last I saw of her, she was carjacking somebody's Pontiac on the freeway nearby.

What can you do with your hands? Damn near everything. What could you do, if you had more hands, and didn't have to protect the safety of what they're attached to? Even more. Handmaid isn't a big-name villain yet, but I'd highly recommend her for any job you've got, and I think this lady is going places.
